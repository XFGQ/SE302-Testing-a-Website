# Sweet Shop — Playwright E2E Test Suite ✅

A concise Playwright end-to-end test suite for the **Sweet Shop** demo application used in Homework 02. The tests verify key flows like login, form validation, cart behavior, page navigation, and UI badge/count updates.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **What it is:** An automated test suite written with **Playwright** (`@playwright/test`) that verifies the main user flows of the Sweet Shop demo (login, shopping cart, About page, form validation).
- **Main files:**
  - `tests/Homework02.spec.ts` — test scenarios
  - `pages/LoginPage.ts` — page object for login
  - `pages/ShopPage.ts` — page object for shop/cart
  - `playwright.config.ts` — Playwright configuration
- **Artifacts / outputs:** `playwright-report/` (HTML reports), `test-results/` (raw test-run data and traces)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g., Node 18+)
- npm (bundled with Node)
- Windows or Linux terminal/shell access

---

## 💻 Installation (Windows & Linux)

Open a terminal in the repository `Test-Cases` folder.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

3. (Linux only) If Chromium needs extra OS libraries:

```bash
npx playwright install-deps
```

**Optional:** Add convenient npm scripts to `package.json` (example):

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "npx playwright test",
  "test:headed": "npx playwright test --headed",
  "show-report": "npx playwright show-report"
}
```

---

## ▶️ Run tests

- Run all tests (headless, default):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

- Run tests in a specific browser (headed example):

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed
```

- Run a single test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/Homework02.spec.ts
```

- Run tests by title:

```bash
npx playwright test -g "Should login successfully"
```

- Run tests with a simple web UI:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

This opens a small web page in your browser. You can see the list of tests, run tests by clicking, and see results there. Run this in the project folder. Make sure browsers are installed first with `npx playwright install`.

---

## 📊 View reports & traces

- Open the HTML report after a run:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

- Raw artifacts and traces:
  - `playwright-report/`
  - `test-results/`

---

## ✅ Test cases covered (high-level)

This suite includes E2E scenarios such as:

- Login success and negative login scenarios (empty input, incorrect credentials)
- Form validation tests (prevent empty form submission)
- Cart operations: add to cart, remove from cart, clear basket
- Badge/count updates when adding/removing items
- Navigation to About page and other UI flow checks

For exact test names, see `tests/Homework02.spec.ts` and historical runs in `test-results/`.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Tips

- If tests fail due to missing browser libraries on Linux, run:

```bash
npx playwright install-deps
```

- Windows PowerShell: If `npm install` shows an error about PowerShell, open PowerShell as **Administrator** and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Type `y` and press Enter to confirm. Make sure **Node.js** is installed on your computer.

- Use `--headed` to observe actions during debugging.
- Increase timeouts in `playwright.config.ts` for slow environments.
- Re-run flaky tests and inspect traces in `test-results/` to identify flakiness.

---

## 💡 Notes

- This repository uses `@playwright/test` as a devDependency (see `package.json`).
- To add CI integration, create a job that runs: `npm ci && npx playwright install && npx playwright test`.

---

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add the suggested npm scripts to `package.json`,
- Create a sample GitHub Actions workflow for running tests on push, or
- Tailor the README wording to your preferred style.
